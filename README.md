### Letting Go of the Code

**How comfortable are you with letting go of the control and structure of your drawing? What parameters have you developed? At what point did your work move into unexpected designs? Did it lose its intended aesthetics?**

So this class took a turn for the harder in the past couple of week. At first, I thought it would be really similar to HTML and CSS, which I learned really quickly and easily. It, however, is not like HTML and CSS but very different. I'm still wrapping my mind around the basics such as classes and variables. 

As far as conceptually, I'm very comfortable with letting go of the structure and control of my sketches. I actually really enjoy seeing what randomness can do. In fact, due to my limited knowlege of p5.js, the petals on my flowers don't at all look like I originally intended but I still like them-- the unevenness kind of adds to it. 

The first sketch I untended to make was going to be two "people" moving around the screen without bumping into one another, just as people sometimes do in life. Many people, myself included, are so caught up in their individual lives that they forget other people exist in the world, living out parallel but unknown lives. However, I ended up switching to the flowers sketch because, realizing my personal limitations in my knowlege of code, I didn't have the tools necessary to make it. Maybe it'll have to do with my next sketch project for this class.
